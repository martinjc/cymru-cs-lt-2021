            <h1>All-Wales Computer Science Learning and Teaching ... thing</h1>
            <p>
                2020 has been quite a year.</p><p>It has been suggested that a lightweight event that would allow us as Computer Science educators to share experiences and lessons learnt as a result of teaching in the time of COVID and to look forwards to the post-COVID future would be a 'good idea' ... so here we are.
